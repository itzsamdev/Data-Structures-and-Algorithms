A tree is non - linear and a hierarchical data structure consisting of
a collection of nodes such that each node of the tree stores a value and
a list of references to left child and right child.

Binary Tree - The Binary tree means that the node can have maximum two children. Here, binary name itself suggests that 'two'; therefore, each node can have either 0, 1 or 2 children.

> > Properties of a Binary Tree:

1. Number of edges: An edge can be defined as the connection between two nodes. There is only one path from each node to any other node of the tree.

2. Depth of a node: The depth of a node is defined as the length of the path from the root to that node. Each edge adds 1 unit of length to the path. So, it can also be defined as the number of edges in the path from the root of the tree to the node.

3. Height of a node: The height of a node can be defined as the length of the longest path from the node to a leaf node of the tree.

4. Height of the Tree: The height of a tree is the length of the longest path from the root of the tree to a leaf node of the tree.

5. At each level of i, the maximum number of nodes is 2i.

~ Tree Problems follows a recursive structure.
~ Very Important topic for Interviews.
~ Mostly all problems can be solved by dividing the problem into subproblems and making recursive calls on subtrees or iteratively.
